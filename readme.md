# dashboard

A little webpage that my raspberry pi home server displays. It shows weather and a QR code that you can use to sign into the WiFi.

This project pulls weather data from the [NOAA REST API](https://weather-gov.github.io/api/general-faqs). I'm using it to practice navigating complicated API schemas. It also has a pretty forecast view using `chart.js` for temperature graphs.
